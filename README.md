##Running instructions

The assets inside /Resources/Public/Assets/Css,  /Resources/Public/Assets/Js, /Resources/Public/Assets/Img_layout
are provided by the project my-foundation-1 (https://github.com/erredeco/my-foundation-1)
in that project you will find a task named "deploy" that copies all the assets into that folders;
please see the readme.md of that project about how to adjust the path
note that the task has no "watch" so far so it must be run manually!

so:

1) download https://github.com/erredeco/my-foundation-1 
2) decompress it into a folder, e.g  
C:\Users\riccardo.decontardi\Documents\Progetti\Public_assets_for_typo3.whatever.it (win)
Users/riccardo/Progetti/Public_assets_for_typo3.whatever.development.it (mac)

3) adjust the path "deploydir" (see documentation of my-foundation-1)

4) open terminal and run
  - npm install or yarn install
  - gulp deploy
  or gulp deploy --env production
